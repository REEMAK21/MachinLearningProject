**TECHBALANCE:** to  Classifying Mental Health Status

Technology has profoundly transformed how we communicate, work, and entertain ourselves. While innovations like social media and artificial intelligence have made life more convenient, excessive use of technology can negatively affect mental health by increasing isolation and reducing real-world interactions. This is particularly concerning as mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and social isolation have become more prevalent. Understanding the relationship between technology usage and mental health is critical to addressing these challenges.
The rapid growth of technology usage significantly impacts daily life. Activities such as prolonged screen time, social media engagement, and gaming have been linked to disrupted sleep, increased stress, and reduced interpersonal connections. Addressing this issue requires identifying the behavioral patterns that influence mental health outcomes. Our project aims to classify an individual's mental health status—Excellent, Good, Fair, or Poor—based on their technology usage patterns, using data-driven machine learning methods.
Task: Predict and classify mental health status into Excellent, Good, Fair, or Poor.
Input: A dataset of 10,000 users with features such as screen time, social media usage, gaming hours, stress levels, and sleep patterns.
Output: A classification label indicating mental health status.
Evaluation Metrics: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix will measure model performance.
